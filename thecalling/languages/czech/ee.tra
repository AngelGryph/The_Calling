/*
Translator note:

Since BGIIEE uses slightly different formatting and conventions than vBG2, this file allows you to override strings for *only* BGEE/EET.
When The Calling is installed on non-EE games, only strings from setup.tra are used. On BGEE/EET, strings defined here will override the strings
from setup.tra. This does not need to be a complete copy of setup.tra, ONLY for the strings that are different between vanilla and EE games.
This file is also formatted in utf-8 since it's only used on EE games. setup.tra will be converted on the fly for EE.

This file can be left blank, but cannot be deleted.
